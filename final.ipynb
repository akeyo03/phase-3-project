    "\n",
    "1. Id - a unique way of identifying different patients in the hospital as different patients have different aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pregnancies - this is our predictor variable that allows us to determine mothers who have already existing diabetes based on their number of pregnancies they have had before and compare with mothers who do not have diabetes also based on their previous pregnancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Glucose - this is an important feature and our predictor variable, in determining diabetes as the level of glucose in a person determines if there is possibility of diabetes developing or not. This is because high level of glucose above average in the body may lead to type 2 diabetes developing or gestational diabetes during pregnancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Blood pressure -This is a predictor variable this that is used to determine hypertension or high blood pressure in individuls as people with diabetes are often associated with a high risk of developing hypertension. High blood pressure may be sometimes an indication of a diabetic person.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Skin thickness - this feature(predictor variable) is used as symptom of indicating a diabetic person as they experience skin changes such as thickening of the skin in certain areas such as the neck and armpits this depends on the level of thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Insulin - this feature(predictor variable) allows us to determine presence of diabetes as decrease of insulin on the body below average can lead to development of type 1 diabetes. This feature allows us to target individuals likely to develop diabetes based on the level of insulin.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Body mass index - this feature(predictor variable) allows us to identify individuals who are overweight and are at risk of developing diabetes based on their weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Diabetes pedigree function - this feature and predictor variable is important as it is an estimate that is used to estimate an individual risk of developing diabetes based on genetics. DPF between 1-2 shows the individual is at moderate risk of developing diabetes while below 1 shows the individual is at low risk of developing diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Age - this is a feature(predictor variable) that is used to determine presence of diabetes, as people get older their bodies tend to become less sensitive to insulin. Another reason is that muscle mass often decreases and impact how the body processes glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Outcome - this is our target variable that shows us with individuals has a possibility of developing diabetes based on the predictor variables and which individuals do not have diabetes based on the predictor variables. Indicated by 0s and 1s as it is binary.\n",
